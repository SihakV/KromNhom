## Code Quality Compliance

- [ ] CHK001 KISS Principle: Implementation uses simplest approach that meets requirements
- [ ] CHK002 Single Responsibility: Each component has one clear responsibility
- [ ] CHK003 Dependency Inversion: External dependencies abstracted through interfaces
- [ ] CHK004 Open/Closed: New functionality added through extension, not modification
- [ ] CHK005 Modular Architecture: Clear module boundaries with minimal coupling

## Implementation Verification

- [ ] CHK006 No over-engineering or unnecessary abstractions
- [ ] CHK007 Clear separation between data, business logic, and presentation layers
- [ ] CHK008 Interface-based design for cross-layer communication
- [ ] CHK009 Consistent naming aligned with domain language

## Notes
